# Celestix
Celestix is a backend project for an OGFN that I was working on but never had the time to complete.

Current Features:
Lobby Support: You can get into lobby and thats about it for now.


Future Plans:
Database Support: I might add database but who knows.
Completion: Thereâ€™s potential to finish the backend, but progress is uncertain at this point.
